<h1>First, a history of piracy</h1>									
<p>Love it or hate it, it's hard to deny that Online piracy is an essential part of the internet in the year 2019. According to go-gulf.com, 22% of all global bandwidth is used for internet piracy. 
The fundamental objection to piracy is that stealing is bad, I think most people would agree with that. However, the argument is more complicated than just that. This article tries to address the people who might feel that piracy is morally reprehensible and is completely opposed to it. If you already understand the argument for piracy and against piracy and the history of piracy then this article may not be for you. But before I can explain why I think piracy will actually save the industry First I need to briefly explain what online piracy is and the history of piracy. 
</p>
<p>
Online piracy is otherwise known as internet piracy first came to prominence in 1999 with the advent of P2P (peer to peer) sharing system. It's important to understand what a P2P network is as it’s fundamental to online piracy historically and in the modern day. A P2P network is a type of sharing network were people<a class="customimages" data-tippy="picture: Netlfix"href=""><img src="assets/images/p2p.jpg" align="left"height="420x" style="border: 20px solid white" ></a> who use the network to download something, it also roots the file into your system so you spread the file around(rooting). This allows files to be shared without ever needing a centralized server to store any data. Thus this allowed files to be shared without being able to be shut down since the files that are being downloaded came from all over the place.
</p>

<h1>Here's why we need it</h1>
<p>This leads us to the push back against piracy. Ever since its conception people have been trying to stop the widespread use of piracy. Their main argument against it is that It discourages creators to create new works if they are not able to profit from it. This argument may sound convincing but if you examine it closely you can easily find holes in them. First, let’s tackle the argument that taking from the creators discourages them. I want to make it clear that the argument that I make is only against big corporations and not against indie developers or small creators. However, not all companies suffer to the same degree against piracy. In reality piracy actually helps the industry. This is because most mega-corporations that deliver digital content do not actually care about your feedback and only notices you when you turn away your wallet. In Fact the sole point of most companies is to provide or deliver as little or as cheap of a product for you as possible whilst still being able to keep your money, unfortunately, that is just the nature of a free market enterprise. If you want proof of this looks no further than the multi-billion dollar company, Netflix. 
</p>

<p>
In many cases, Netflix is buying up the IP (intellectual property) rights of movies and tv shows and making it impossible for them to watch anywhere else. On the surface, the business models that companies like Netflix go by seem to be beneficial to the consumer. But in reality 
This business model actually creates two major issues for the digital market. Firstly, because the companies that are aggregating shows only need to buy up the IP’s, they are not actually innovating and only leeching off of creators. Secondly, and possibly more importantly, the fact that when businesses buy up IP’s they make it impossible for consumers to access the content without using their service. This strongly disadvantages the consumers since they are forced into purchasing a service for a product and thus cannot solely purchase the content they want but also purchase the service that comes with it.
</p>

<h1>This is where piracy comes in to play.</h1>

<p> when you pirate something you are essentially boycotting a company whilst still being able to enjoy the benefits of not giving away the content. Pirating empowers the consumers and forces monopolies to rethink their business strategies. In an age where big corporations are playing an increasingly large role in our lives, piracy becomes one of the only tools that can prevent companies from completely taking over our lives. But not only is anti-piracy measures widely ineffective, in many cases,<a class="customimages" data-tippy="picture: Netfix"href=""><img src="assets/images/Netflix.jpg" align="right"height="420x" style="border: 20px solid white" ></a> they actually hinder the enjoyment of people who purchase the content legally. Piracy is an especially Interesting case when it comes to the video game industry. Because companies have been trying to prevent it for a very long time. Often DRM (digital rights management) is implemented in a way that makes it so normal players have a worse time then the pirates. Like in the case of sim city were in EA tried to prevent piracy by forcing players to sign-in whilst pirates were able to just bypass that.

</p>

<p>Lastly, let's talk about inaccessibility and unavailability. Even if didn’t agree with any of my previous arguments I hope that this one at least makes the most amount of sense. Something that is often forgotten by people living in western countries is that content provider, distributors 
And even game makers often don't license or sell their products in every country in the world. Often, the case is actually that people who live in countries like China are not always able to legally watch the content or have access to a legal way to obtain the media. Therefore, in those cases, it’s almost always going to be the case that piracy will win out. 
</p>

<h1>In Conclusion,</h1>
<p>not only is piracy a good way to help the market and correct its problems. It also serves as an important tool to help stop the spread monopolies taking over a service. Whatever you take away from this article may be. Just know that I do not condone piracy as it is considered illegal in many places in the world. Furthermore, Please realize that there are many dangers when it comes to pirating things on the internet. Sites like pirate bay often feature malicious programs that can harm your computer and steal your personal information. Every claim I’ve made in this article is very biased and therefore you should do your own research into the subject.
