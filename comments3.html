<h1>A preface,</h1>
<p>This article has some of the same information that was already previously covered in another article written on this website. If you want more information on monopolies please check out that article. Furthermore, this article will mostly tackle monopolies in the United States since those are usually the most well-documented cases. Anyways, what I wanted to talk about in this article is sort of a continuation of monopolies in the tech industry. I want to identify what companies are doing and why those things are harmful to consumers. Another subject I want to address later in the article is the IP and exclusives in the video games industry as it’s analogous to monopolies</p>

<p>Let’s start off by talking about the most hated company in America, Comcast. That’s right according to PCMAG, Comcast the internet service provider is considered by consumers to be the worst company in America. This is related to the article because Comcast is one of the most blatant cases of monopolies that are currently running. In fact, The whole internet broadband service industry could be considered a monopoly. What makes this industry a blatant monopoly is that these companies have actually signed agreements so that they never have to compete against each other. What's more According to Gizmodo, ISP often lobbies in a way that does not allow new companies to compete with the pre-existing ones. When new companies form they often also have to run your own internet lines, which are very expensive. This essentially leaves the pre-existing ISP’s uncontestable.
</p>

<p>Now that we’ve established that there is a monopoly, what is the actual issue with these internet broadband monopolies? As explained in my previous article, is that they will try to earn as much money as they can from you as possible. Furthermore, if they are the sole company that offers the good (Ie: a monopoly) they can charge you as much as they want, furthermore they can get away business practices without facing any repercussion from the consumer. And nowhere is there more evidence of bad business practices than in the Internet broadband industry. Even when faced with change Comcast is unwilling to play ball even a little bit. According to the Verge,  When Google started to introduce their high-speed broadband service in the form of google fiber, which they claim offer internet speeds that were one hundred times faster than the internet speed of the average American household. But according to Comcast and Time Warner people don’t want faster internet speeds. 
</p>

<h1>Comcast, money over consumers</h1>
<p>A similarly ridiculous claim could be seen made by the Ceo of Comcast  Brian Roberts, when interviewed by business insider about the implementation of a 300gb data cap he said that “The more bits you use, the more you pay” and justifying this by saying that "Just as with every other thing in your life, if you drive 100,000 miles or 1,000 miles you buy more gasoline. If you turn on the air conditioning to 60 vs. 72 you consume more electricity,". However, this would at best be considered untrue. When we look at gasoline, we know that it is a finite resource. Moreover, if we look at electricity, we know that it needs to be produced. But when we look at the infrastructure relating to broadband internet, once it is built it no longer needs to be replenished, nor does it a finite resource. This makes the claims that Brian Roberts sound more like a cash grab than technological necessity. According to Ars Technica, Comcast themselves later even admitted to the data cap being nothing more than a business tactic. 
</p>
<h1>the seperation of software and hardware</h1>
<p>Another problem I that is rarely addressed in the tech industry is the separation of software and hardware. Essentially the argument is that after you buy a product you should be able to decide what you want to do with it. Moreover, the software that you have on the device should not be forcibly overseen by the company that made the hardware. A good example of this being the case is with Apple. Everyone who uses an Apple device probably knows about how great their “ecosystem” is. This usually refers to how Apple’s Operating system is able to interact with the operating systems of your other devices, creating an environment that facilitates simplicity and efficiency. However, if you examine it closely you will notice that what Apple has done is far from creating an ecosystem, what they’ve created could actually be considered a walled garden. In fact, according to the verge, Apple is even getting sued right now for not allowing third-party apps to run on your phone without having to be installed on the app store. The only way to install non-apple pre-approved apps is by jailbreaking your phone and voiding your warranty. 
</p>
The same problem could be seen in the video game industry. Companies like Sony have very strict rules against changing their operating systems. According to Cnet when Sony first released their Playstation 3’s they had promised that they could install a Linux operating system onto the PS3 if you had wanted to. Unfortunately, after only a few months Sony removed the feature after hackers found a way to have access to the whole system. And when it comes to Nintendo, things don’t get much better. Known for their console exclusives Nintendo is infamous for not competing with the rest of the industry. Even though Nintendo almost always have worse hardware, the only reason people purchase their products is that they have exclusive titles that are not on any other platform. The reason why this is a bad thing for the industry is because it is essentially abusing anti-trust laws which were implemented to promote competition not stifle it. According to the Federal Trade Commission,  the point of antitrust laws was implemented to give consumers quote “the benefits of lower prices, higher quality products and services, more choices, and greater innovation.” However, when Nintendo uses the laws so that they can hold exclusive rights to their intellectual property, thus not allowing anyone else to port over the games to other consoles, they are openly exploiting a system to their own benefit.
